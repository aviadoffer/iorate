iorate I/O performance testing tool (originally by EMC)

iorate was created in 1997 by Vince Westin of EMC. EMC had a tool, but it was for internal use at EMC. So to fill this need, iorate was created.

Iorate is freely available for public use now. Though this was developed by EMC staff with EMC resources, the code is available for anyone to use. There are no EMC-specific pieces to the testing, it just tests storage. It has been used by EMC customers around the world. 
Use the downloads pages to get a copy to try for yourself. Be sure to read the User Guide and consider using the modeling workbook for constructing new workload models, which can both be found on the downloads page.

This is an attempt to keep it alive since it's a very useful and intutive tool
